- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking for any advice on getting that first dev job, especially as a non-traditional student/ grad. 
- 🌱 I’m currently fine tuning my GPA appilcation, it all works (YAY!), but its ugly (BOO). There is also some other functionality that I want to try and add to it. I am also currently questioning the uses of var, let, const, everytime I try and look up code/ help I feel like var is being used, but shoud I be trying to use let and const more???? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu or chelsea.j.bush@gmail.com

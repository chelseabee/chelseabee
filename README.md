- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking to enroll in a BS in software dev/ engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C# is awesome, but I think I need something that is a little more simple to become proficient in prior to adding all the classes/ converts / things about C# that made my head spin. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu

debating: cloud commputing vs software dev??? so far Software Dev is winning, but self doubt is a factor.

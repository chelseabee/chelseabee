- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking for any advice on getting that first dev job, especially as a non-traditional student/ grad. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java - today is conditionals/ control flows, which is mostly review for me, but useful none the less. I commited to a BS in Software Dev today, I was a bit leery because I already have a BA and I felt like a 2nd bachelors may look bad, but I am following my gut and going for it. I have gotten pretty far in my self learning, but I always felt a gap in my knowledge especially in algos/ logic, hopefully with this degree I can fight some of those things that have been holding me back.I am really excited for the first time in a long time and I can not wait to start!
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things frontend and maybe possibly backend, the more I learn the more I want to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript - finally starting to click with Javascript I think!! I did a build along calculator and it was a great learning expereince! SO SO SO much easier to learn to code while actually building something!! I am kind of curious how much JS frontend devs actually use? From what I am gathering they can use something like react and basically write a whole pages html with JS/React componenets, but otherwise is it mostly for interactive elements? off I go to learn more....... 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things front end 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript ----- still .... is it this hard for everyone to grasp? Currently revisting some free code camp curriculum, and I feel like im understanding more, but I am having a hard time, switching from these small tutorial tasks to real world application. I feel like whenever I need a Jacascript element for my webpages I am googling and finding out how to do it rather than implementing it myself.... is this how it is? I think I am at a point where I need some mentorship or code-friendship. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

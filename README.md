- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things front end 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript loops, and starting to think about what I actually need to know to land a real job. Trying to shape a learning plan for leetcode type problems while creating web pages for my portfolio, and further my knowledge of css tools. I have found that learning multiple things at once keeps me much more engaged vs trying to only learn one topic at a time. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

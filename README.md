- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things frontend and maybe possibly backend, the more I learn the more I want to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript - Still chugging along, decided to work on a new project today using HTML/SCSS/JS, and its fairly JS heavy and easy enough to navigate mostly on my own even if I am a little stuck at the moment. Feeling confident about this one!
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

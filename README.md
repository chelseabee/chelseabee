- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking to enroll in a BS in software dev/ engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java - today is methods, which I like! At first the extra documentation in Java seemed a bit annoying (coming from JS) but I am learning to actually appreciate it in a way. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu

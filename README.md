- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things frontend and maybe possibly backend, the more I learn the more I want to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript - switched over from FCC to a Udemy course, which I honestly think is much better for really grasping the content. Using only the tutorials on FCC doesnt allow for actual application, so even after hours of "learning" I never felt able to build something. It is good for very basic learning I think, like what is a variable, etc but beyond that at least for me I cannot pick up the concepts without actually applying them in a project. curently using the complete JS course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller, and he's great! Thankful that I found him. I am now thinking I may have an interest in learning backend as well, I think I am a forever learner and I dont think I will ever feel satisfied, whihch makes software a pretty perfect choice for me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

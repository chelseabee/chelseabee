- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking for any advice on getting that first dev job, especially as a non-traditional student/ grad. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about javascript focused on DOM right now, I have learned alot trough building my own projects, but there are some small bits and pieces that I didnt know before which I think will be really helpful. I have been going through some of Angela Wu's videos on Udemy, and woah she is so easy to learn from. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu or chelsea.j.bush@gmail.com

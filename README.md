- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking for any advice on getting that first dev job, especially as a non-traditional student/ grad. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about javascript and trying to decide on a framework. I am currently leaning towards vue because I have read that it is speedy and easiest to learn, but react is the most popular sooooo which to pick?? Anyways, I am looking forward to having a frameworked project completed soon!
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu or chelsea.j.bush@gmail.com

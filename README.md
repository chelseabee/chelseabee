- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things frontend and maybe possibly backend, the more I learn the more I want to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript - Javascript WHYYYYYY! lol uggg! I feel like I have really advanced in my JS knowledge, but I am having trouble actully writing in JS, is this something everyone deals with?????? I am working on UDEMY and some leet code problems, hoping that I can become more condfident, and make better logical decisions. I seem to want to overcomplicate things (nothing new there). Any who, I am kind of getting an itch to learn Python, but debating if that may set back my JS knowledge that I have accumulated, perhaps I should try some react or vue instead??? Decisions decisions!
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things front end 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript Arrays, and trying out some react and bootstrap, I ran into a problem with my portfolio, being that I don't have any projects to really display, so currently working on some projects, thinking a landing page with an authentification might be a good one, is this even possible without backend technologies??? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things frontend and maybe possibly backend, the more I learn the more I want to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript - I finished my todo list, I have a couple things to work out, but overall it works and it looks great! I have been working on an ecommerce page for Frontend Mentor which I have been able to get looking right, but some functionality is kind of stumping me. I am not sure if I should try and work through it or return to my Udemy course so that I can try and learn more of the required skills, the answer is probably a little bit of both. Well here I go, Ill try and load my current progress on here. *** I forgot to mention I have been doing the 100 days of code over on my instagram, I wish I would have done it sooner, I am learning so much and I just love it!!
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

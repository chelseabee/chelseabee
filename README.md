- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently interested in all things frontend and maybe possibly backend, the more I learn the more I want to learn!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript - I am still working on my todolist, I think I may add it on here so that i can update the progress as i go. I am officailly stuck trying to get items to delete off my list, but thats okay with me. I dont like the feeling of being stuck, but I do like how many things you can uncover and learn when you are in a place of 'stuck'. Hopefully I will figure it all out soon, I am trying to use my own logic and functions without really borrowing ideas. It makes me realize that I am learning a lot, a week ago I would never have gotten this far. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with other code newbies

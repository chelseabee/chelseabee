- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking for any advice on getting that first dev job, especially as a non-traditional student/ grad. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about javascript and brushing up on bootstrap. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu or chelsea.j.bush@gmail.com

- Currently building out a menu/ cart program using JS, thinking of also implementing it with Java so I can get practice in building with both languages. I definitley have the coding bug again and I am so happy about that. I think that having time to building things and really enjoying the things that you are creating makes a whole world of difference.

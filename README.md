- 👋 Hi, I’m @chelseabee
- 👀 I’m currently looking for any advice on getting that first dev job, especially as a non-traditional student/ grad. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and brushing up on css/HTML working on JavaScript again. I'm currently trying to build a gpa calculator, but some of the JS logic is confusing me. I'm trying to find an average of a float using userInput, but I dont know if I need to parse to int/ float or if JS will convert the types for me??? 
- 💞️ I’m looking to make connections with anyone who feels like coding can be really hard sometimes, but wont give up! 
- 📫 How to reach me: chelsea.bush@wsu.edu or chelsea.j.bush@gmail.com
